# Project Plan — Event Ticketing Platform

Portfolio project (concerts/sports/shows) built with Spec-Driven Development to demonstrate Kafka/event-driven architecture, microservices, and full-stack (Spring Boot + Angular) skills.

**Stack:** Spring Boot 4.1.0 · Java 25 · Spring Cloud Gateway · Apache Kafka · PostgreSQL (per service) · Redis · Angular 17+ · Docker/K8s · GCP Cloud Run · Stripe sandbox · Testcontainers 1.21.4

---

## Phases

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Specs — OpenAPI 3.1 per service, AsyncAPI 2.x for Kafka, ADRs, C4 diagram | Done |
| 2 | Scaffolding — Spring Boot stubs from specs, Docker Compose infra | Done |
| 3 | Core backend — one service at a time, starting with booking-service | In progress |
| 4 | Angular frontend — SVG seat map, countdown timer, WebSocket | Not started |
| 5 | DevOps — GitHub Actions CI/CD, K8s manifests, GCP Cloud Run | Not started |

Phase order and scope are unchanged from the original plan. What's new is the delivery rule below, which governs how work inside phases 3 and 4 gets broken up and checkpointed.

## Delivery rule: testable slices

Starting now, every unit of work inside a phase (a service in Phase 3, a feature in Phase 4) is broken into small, independent, **end-to-end vertical slices** rather than built as one large implementation.

Each slice must:
- Produce an observable, checkable result — a real request/response, not just code + unit tests (e.g. "`POST /events` creates an event and `GET /events/{id}` returns it," not the full CRUD + validation + edge cases in one go).
- Include a way to verify it: a `demo.sh` addition, a curl example, or tests that exercise the real path.
- Be small enough to stay fully comprehensible on its own.

**Checkpoint:** work pauses after each slice for review before the next slice starts. Slices are not chained together without a checkpoint in between.

## Phase 3 progress

### booking-service — done
Happy-path slice: hold seat → confirm booking → saga via Kafka. 39 tests passing (unit, controller, repository via Testcontainers Cloud, saga integration). Migrated to Spring Boot 4.1.0 / Java 25 (see `docs/spring-boot-4-migration.md`).

### booking-service ↔ event-service — event-level binding done

`booking-service` now calls `event-service` (`GET /events/{id}`) via a Spring `RestClient` (`EventServiceClient`) when holding a seat: it validates the event exists and fetches its real `title`, replacing the previously client-supplied `eventTitle` field. Returns 404 (`EventNotFoundException`) if the event doesn't exist, 503 (`EventServiceUnavailableException`) if event-service is unreachable.

Seat-level fields (`seatId`, `seatLabel`, `priceGbp`) remain client-supplied — `event-service` has no per-seat model yet (only aggregate `Section` row/seat counts), so full seat-level binding is deferred until seat map generation exists (see below).

Config: `event.service.base-url` (`http://localhost:8081` locally, `http://event-service:8081` in docker-compose via `EVENT_SERVICE_BASE_URL`). Verified against the real containerized event-service via `demo.sh` (not just a mocked integration test) — confirmed `eventTitle` in the booking response is fetched live, not client-supplied.

Also fixed while verifying end-to-end: `payment-simulator`'s `pom.xml` still declared `spring-kafka` instead of `spring-boot-starter-kafka` (a leftover gap from the earlier Spring Boot 4 migration), which meant it had no autoconfigured `KafkaTemplate` bean and crash-looped instead of consuming `payment-initiated` — silently masked before because `BookingSagaIntegrationTest` publishes `payment-completed` directly via its own Testcontainers Kafka rather than exercising the real `payment-simulator`.

### event-service — Slice 1 done

- `POST /venues` — create a venue with sections (capacity computed from rows × seatsPerRow)
- `POST /events` — create an event tied to a venue (denormalizes venueName/city onto Event, status defaults to PUBLISHED)
- `GET /events/{id}` — fetch an event
- `GET /events` — list events, filterable by city/category/dateFrom/dateTo, paginated

Spring Boot 4.1.0 / Java 25, real Postgres persistence (own database `ticketing_events`, database-per-service). 13 tests passing: `VenueControllerTest` (2), `EventControllerTest` (6), `VenueRepositoryTest` (1), `EventRepositoryTest` (4, filter specs via Testcontainers). Wired into `docker/docker-compose.yml` (port 8081) and `demo.sh` (venue/event creation steps, independent of the booking-service flow).

Deferred to later slices: seat map generation (`GET /events/{eventId}/seats`), update/cancel event, venue lookup by ID (`GET /venues/{venueId}`), listing venues, and full seat-level binding for booking-service (blocked on seat map generation existing).

**Next up:** start a new service (payment-service, notification-service, waitlist-service, api-gateway) or continue deepening event-service (seat map generation, etc.).

### Remaining services (not yet scoped into slices)
payment-service, notification-service, waitlist-service, api-gateway

## Outstanding housekeeping

- No git remote configured yet — local commits (through `2657353`, Spring Boot 4 migration) need a remote once ready to push.
- Testcontainers Cloud free plan is capped at 50 min/month — reserve integration test runs for genuine breakage or final pre-commit verification, not speculative re-runs.
